# AI-Powered-Infrastructure-DSL-Pipeline

> Build Infrastructure from Natural Language â€” Powered by LLMs, CrewAI, and Terraform.  
> Designed to mirror real-world AI Infra platforms like those inside Airbnb, AWS, and NVIDIA.

---

## Overview

This project showcases an **AI-first Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) pipeline**, where a user describes their infrastructure requirements in **natural language**, and the system generates **modular, production-grade Terraform code**, injects secrets, validates policies, and applies it after human approval.

ðŸ’¡ Example:  
You write â†’ `"Provision a 3-tier VPC with public and private subnets, an EC2 in the private subnet, and an RDS DB"`  
This system â†’ Generates production-level HCL code with best practices.

## ðŸ§± Architecture

```bash
terraform-ai-dsl/
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/                 # CrewAI agents (parser, planner, generator, validator, executor)
â”œâ”€â”€ crew/                   # CrewAI task orchestration logic
â”œâ”€â”€ pipelines/              # NLP-to-DSL and DSL-to-Terraform pipeline
â”œâ”€â”€ terraform/              # Final generated Terraform project (main.tf, variables.tf, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ modules/                # Reusable Terraform modules (vpc, ec2, rds, alb, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                   # Terraform Docs auto-generated here
â”œâ”€â”€ secrets/                # Encrypted secrets (KMS or Vault ready)
â”œâ”€â”€ compliance/             # Regional tagging, policy rules, allow/deny lists
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                  # Unit tests for DSL interpretation and HCL correctness
